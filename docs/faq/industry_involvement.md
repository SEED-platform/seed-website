## Do any applications use SEED to store and analyze building construction permit applications for energy code compliance?

We are not aware of any applications which use SEED to do this, although SEED could be linked to another tool, like SalesForce.  We recommend contacting Earth Advantage and Clearly Energy for more details (see the [technical allies page](../technical_ally.md)).
