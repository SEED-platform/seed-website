# FAQ - Features - Miscellaneous

## How can I get general information about the capabilities, features, and active development of SEED?

* For a list of new features and fixed capabilities, visit the [SEED Platform GitHub Releases](https://github.com/SEED-platform/seed/releases) page.

* Consult the [Reference Page](../../references.md) for publications related to SEED. Additionally, this paper describes the BuildingSync® format which can be used to import data into the SEED Platform:
	* DeGraw, Jason, Kristin Field-Macumber, Nicholas Long, and Supriya Goel. 2018. [“BuildingSync® in Action : Example Implementations.”](https://buildingsync.net/documents/DeGraw-ACEEE-BuildingSync-in-Action.pdf) In 2018 ACEEE Summer Study on Energy Efficiency in Buildings, 1–12. Pacific Grove, CA.

* Here are some related projects that are using SEED:
	* [The BayREN Integrated Commercial Retrofits (BRICR) Project](https://aceee.org/files/proceedings/2018/#/paper/event-data/p110) and [BRICR Presentation](https://www.energy.gov/sites/prod/files/2018/05/f52/24293_Hooper_050318-900.pdf)
	* [The Energy Data Vault (EDV) Project](https://www.energy.gov/eere/buildings/energy-data-vault)

## Do you anticipate any SEED issues if there are irregular data updates for each building? For example, with a point-of-sale benchmarking program, building data would only be updated when a property is sold.

There should not be any issues importing data at non-regular times; users frequently do so with ENERGY STAR Portfolio Manager data.
