# App Developer Requirements

## Description

Application ("App") developers use the SEED Platform application programming interface (API) to offer value-added services using data hosted in SEED Platform.

## Example

A company could use the SEED Platform API to create mobile apps or web sites that offer new data visualization, summary statistics, and extended workflows.

## Benefits to Technical Ally

- Official standing as Technical Ally, including promotion and recognition opportunities
- License to use SEED Platform trademark
- Limited technical support
- Access to SEED Platform Collaborative community (ability to share product/service offerings with users, user forum, Collaborative calls and webinars, events such as the Better Buildings Challenge)

## Requirements

App developer Technical Allies must meet these requirements annually:

- Demonstrate an application built using the SEED Platform API either by:
  - (a) calling the APIs of the LBNL-hosted instance of SEED, or
  - (b) sending the SHA of the SEED version they are using and server logs verifying the API calls.
- Execute a SEED Platform trademark [sublicense](resources/SEED_LBNL_sample_license.pdf) with LBNL.

## Approval Process

To be approved as a SEED-Platform Technical Ally, software contributors must follow this process:

- Develop a stand-alone web or mobile application using the existing SEED Platform API endpoints,
- Contact the SEED Development team using one of the methods on the [contact page](contact.md) to express interest in becoming a Technical Ally or hosting provider,
- Demonstrate your application's functionality to the SEED Development team,
- Documentation must include:
  - Screenshots of app
  - Version of SEED API it is built for
  - List of API endpoints used
  - If app is browser-based, screenshot of browser debug screen showing API endpoints accessed

Please note that any individual or organization is welcome to develop stand-alone apps for the SEED Platform APIs. Official recognition as a Technical Ally is only required when the organization wishes to use the SEED Platform trademark and logo to publicly identify their contributions to the SEED Platform Collaborative.
