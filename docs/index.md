The Standard Energy Efficiency Data Platform (SEED) Platform is an open-source software application designed to manage building performance data (such as required by a benchmarking ordinance) which can be costly and time consuming for states, local governments and other organizations. SEED helps users combine data from multiple sources, clean and validate it, and generate queries and reports.

SEED is funded by the United States Department of Energy. Visit the [DOE Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE) SEED Platform website](http://energy.gov/eere/buildings/standard-energy-efficiency-data-platform) for more general project information.
