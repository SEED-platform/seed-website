# Hosting Provider Requirements

## Description

Hosting providers offer the core open-source functionality of the SEED Platform&trade; as a hosted service to end-users. 

The purpose of approving hosting providers is to ensure that the SEED Platform trademark is being properly used, and end-users who use a SEED-branded service get the experience and core functionality they expect from the SEED Platform application. The operating principle is that modifications to the core open-source code are not allowed, other than minor modifications needed to register plug-ins or make cosmetic changes for purposes of branding the provider’s service offering.

## Example

A company offers a subscription-based service for the SEED Platform software at the web site seed.example.com.
