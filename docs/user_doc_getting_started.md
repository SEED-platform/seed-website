After building data is imported into SEED, it can be accessed from the
Inventory navigation button. The data can be viewed by cycle, as well as
by Property and Tax Lot.

![](images/image32.png)

The links at the top of the page allow different views of the data, as
follows:

#### **Properties List:** Displays the latest version of the Properties List view

#### **Properties List (legacy):** Displays the previous version of the Properties List view which will be deprecated at some point

#### **Column List Profiles:** Allows creation of multiple field lists with different fields selected

#### **Cross-Cycles:** Allows viewing data across multiple cycles

#### **Map:** If the properties have been correctly geocoded, they will be displayed on a map based on those locations

#### **Data:** Links to Insights 

#### **Summary (Beta):** Displays summary information about the records and fields by cycle

## Data {#data .unnumbered}

![](images/image14.png)

The Data navigation tab will take you to the Data Sets view, where Data
Sets (groups of imported files) can be created, and files imported. For
Energy Benchmarking and Building Performance Standards, creating data
sets based on compliance years is a standard method of organizing the
data imports.

![](images/image4.png)

There are several types of data that can be imported, including

-   Spreadsheets with one line per building, such as from Tax Assessor
    data or real estate data

-   ENERGY STAR Portfolio Manager data for one or more buildings with
    Annual Energy Data

-   ENERGY STAR Portfolio Manager data for one or more buildings with
    Monthly Energy Data

-   GeoJSON data for spatial data information, such as latitude and
    longitude

-   Data from the DOE tool Audit Template or Asset Score (via the
    BuildingSync format)

## Insights {#insights .unnumbered}

![](images/image26.png)

The Insights feature in SEED allows analysis of benchmarking or Building
Performance Standards compliance over time based on setting performance
targets into the future and showing how buildings are meeting those
targets, both individually and as a group, over specific time periods.

The image below shows the compliance of a portfolio of buildings over a
5 year time period, 2019 - 2023, with the compliance of the buildings
increasing during that period.

![](images/image2.png)

It is also possible to view the compliance of individual buildings for a
particular period of time (cycle), on the Property Insights page, where
the blue dots indicate buildings that have met their compliance targets,
and the red triangles indicating buildings that have not met their
targets, with the "whisker line" showing the distance from compliance
for those buildings.

![](images/image22.png)

It is also possible to see the compliance trend compared to a target
over time in a graph
