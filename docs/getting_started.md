# Getting Started

## Installation

SEED is a web-based database tool, and therefore must be "hosted" on a web server. It is not designed to be installed on an end-user's desktop computer. There are several options for how SEED can be hosted. The following information will help you select an appropriate type of SEED instance.

If you are a developer, consult the [Developer Getting Started Guide](https://seed-platform.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started.html) for detailed instructions on how to install the SEED Platform locally for development purposes.

### Third-Party Hosting

SEED can be hosted by third-party hosting providers, who will provide access to a SEED account. Providers will be approved and will be responsible for keeping up with the updates to the code. See the Technical Allies page for current hosting providers.

### Self-Hosted

Organizations may want to host their own SEED installation. This requires the SEED source code, installation scripts, and installation instructions, all of which are available in GitHub. Note that SEED is a server-based web application that is not designed to be installed on an end-user's desktop computer. Self-hosting SEED requires some experience with server and database administration and will usually require the involvement of an organization's IT department for installation and operation of a SEED instance.

### Temporary Test Account

We can provide a SEED test account for jurisdictions or organizations that are exploring or in the process of implementing a Building Energy Benchmarking or Building Performance Standard ordinance. For more information, visit the [requesting test Instance](test_instance_request.md) page.
